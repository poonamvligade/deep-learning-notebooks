DL notebooks accompanying my blog and talks.

1. Dinosaur classifier web APP

This DL project shows how I built prehistoric dinosaur identifier from a custom dataset using pytorch, fastai.

And created a simple dashboard for you to play around with using Gradio.

This app is hosted on JarvisLabs.ai - a zero setup modern GPU cloud platform.
